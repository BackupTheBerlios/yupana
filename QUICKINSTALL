mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yupana.* TO 'yupana'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yupana';

2. Insert databse schema

shell> mysql -u yupana -p yupana -h localhost yupana < includes/db/mysql.sql

3. Copy config-dist.php to config.php
   (Note: if you use another values for database name/user/password
    you need to modify config.php to your needs)

4. Create a directory for proposal files and change write permissions

shell> mkdir /full/path/to/archives
shell> chmod 777 /full/path/to/archives

5. Edit $CFG->files in config.php

6. Login into your yupana url http://server/yupana

That's all!

You can login into admin panel in: http://server/yupana/?q=admin with:

If you have mod_rewrite support, to enable clean urls go into configuration and enable it.
