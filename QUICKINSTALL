QUICKINSTALL
============

Once uploaded to webserver:

1. Create database and grant privileges to yupana user with password 'yupana'

mysql> CREATE DATABASE yupana DEFAULT CHARSET 'utf8';

Note: grant all privileges on dbname.* to 'dbuser'@'dbhost' identified by 'dbpass';

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yupana.* TO 'yupana'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yupana';

2. Copy config-dist.php to config.php
   (Note: if you use another values for database name/user/password
    you need to modify config.php to your needs)

3. Create a directory for proposal files and change write permissions

shell> mkdir /full/path/to/archives
shell> chmod 777 /full/path/to/archives

4. Edit $CFG->files in config.php

5. Login into your yupana url http://server/yupana

That's all!

You can login into admin panel in: http://server/yupana/?q=admin with default:

Username: admin
Password: admin

If you have mod_rewrite support, to enable clean urls go into configuration and enable it.
